                generating all LODs, ULOD will still manage the LOD levels, changing the meshes according to the
                distance from the
                camera that is currently displaying an image to the user. All of this automatically. You can customize
                the amount of LODs that will be generated , the distance that
                each LOD level should be shown, the percentage of vertices that the meshes will have at each LOD level,
                etc. ULOD works with static meshes (Mesh Renderers) or animated meshes (Skinned Mesh Renderers).

                Before using ULOD, your meshes must meet some requirements...
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Step 1</b> - All of your meshes (Mesh Filters and Skinned Mesh Renderers) cannot have empty or null
                meshes.
                <div class="image">
                    <center>
                        <img src="Files/Images/1.png" />
                        <br />
                        The mesh filter above, has a null mesh, which will cause it to be ignored during the scanning of
                        the ULOD component, to
                        generate the LODs.
                    </center>
                </div>
                <b>Step 2</b> - Place the "MainCamera" tag on all the main cameras in your game, avoid placing this tag
                on cameras that will not cover
                the entire screen (such as mirror cameras, mini maps, etc.).
                <div class="image">
                    <center>
                        <img src="Files/Images/22.png" />
                        <br />
                        This is particularly useful if you are going to use the "MainCamera" camera detection method in
                        the "Ultimate Level Of
                        Detail" component.

                    How to Generate LODs: Adding and configuring the ULOD component
                </div>
                To start everything, we must first add the component called "Ultimate Level Of Detail" inside a
                GameObject.
                If you want to
                create LODs for an entire Mesh hierarchy, just add ULOD to the parent GameObject for the entire
                hierarchy. If you want
                to generate LODs for a single individual mesh, add the ULOD to the GameObject that contains the
                MeshFilter or Skinned Mesh Renderer for that
                individual mesh.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Meshed GameObjects hierarchy</b> - By adding ULOD to a GameObject parent of a GameObjects hierarchy
                with meshes, ULOD will be able to identify all child
                meshes and recognize them to generate LODs and manage the LODs of all of them.

                        Adding ULOD to a GameObject parent of a GameObjects hierarchy with meshes
                    </center>
                </div>
                <b>To a single mesh</b> - If you want to create LODs from a single mesh, just add the ULOD to the
                GameObject that contains this mesh.
                <div class="image">

                </div>
                <b>Bonus</b> - If you have a mesh hierarchy in GameObjects and a ULOD in the parent GameObject of that
                hierarchy, but you need to customize the LOD parameters
                of a mesh individually, you
                just need to add a ULOD to the GameObject that contains the mesh you want to customize the LOD
                parameters.
                <div class="image">

                </div>
                When adding a ULOD to a child GameObject, it will be possible to customize its parameters, and the
                parameters you define
                will apply only to that child GameObject. All other child GameObjects of the parent ULOD, which do not
                contain ULODs,
                will receive LOD parameters from the parent ULOD.

                        This child ULOD will be identified by the parent ULOD
                    </center>
                </div>
                You can see that the child ULOD has been identified by the parent ULOD, just by clicking on the parent
                ULOD.

                The ULOD child has been identified by the parent ULOD, so the scan of its parent ULOD and child ULODs
                will be
                synchronized. As soon as you start scanning on your parent object, all child ULODs will also start
                scanning
                automatically.

                    How to Generate LODs: Generating LODs
                </div>
                Now that ULOD has been added to your scene, let's do the basic settings and generate all the LODs. ULOD
                works as follows: After configuring all LOD creation parameters, ULOD will scan GameObjects according to
                the
                configuration you define, to find all the meshes that will have LODs created. After scanning,
                identifying
                and collecting
                data for each mesh, it saves all of that cataloged data and then begins creating LOD levels for each
                mesh. Then these
                levels of LODs are saved in your project (if you prefer), after that, the LODs are ready. At this
                point, ULOD will
                change meshes and LOD levels as the camera rendering them moves away or gets closer. If you need to, you
                can undo the creation of the LODs and then ULOD will restore all the original meshes to their proper
                places, erase the LOD levels previously created in your project and erase all saved data that was
                collected from the
                scanned meshes.
                <br />
                <br />
                Now, let's go to the configuration and creation of the LODs. See the step by step below to learn how to
                generate LODs and make ULOD work.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Select the mesh scanning mode</b> - Before generating LODs, ULOD needs you to show it how you want
                the scan to be done. If you added your ULOD to a
                GameObject parent of a mesh hierarchy, select "Scan In Children GameObjects Only". If you added your
                ULOD to a single
                mesh and you do not want ULOD to scan for child GameObjects for mesh, simply select "Scan In This
                GameObject only".
                <div class="image">
                    <center>
                        <img src="Files/Images/4.png" />
                        <br />
                        In the example, the option to scan for meshes on child GameObjects only was selected.
                    </center>
                </div>
                <b>Select the quantity of LODs you want to create, and the quality of each LOD</b> -
                Select the number of LODs you want to create first. You can customize
                the quality level
                that
                each mesh will have at each LOD level. The lower the "percentage of vertices"
                the lower the quality of that LOD, the higher the "percentage of vertices", the higher the quality of
                that LOD.
                <div class="image">
                    <center>
                        <img src="Files/Images/5.png" />
                        <br />
                        LOD levels that will be automatically generated for each scanned mesh
                    </center>
                </div>
                <b>Select the distance at which each LOD level will appear</b> - Finally, we need to set the minimum
                distance required for each LOD level to appear. The lower the quality of an LOD
                level, the greater the minimum distance required for it to appear.
                <br>
                <br>
                Here, you can also define the minimum
                distance required for culling to occur in the meshes. When culling occurs, all
                meshes will be deactivated and will no longer be rendered until the camera approaches closer than the
                distance required
                for culling, then the meshes will be visible again.
                <br>
                <br>
                In this example we have 4 levels of LOD in total.
                <br>
                LOD_0 (it is the original mesh of your model, with all vertices).
                <br>
                And then there are the LODs LOD_1, LOD_2 and LOD_3. The higher the level, the lower the mesh quality
                must be. Therefore, the higher the level, the greater the minimum distance required for that level to be
                seen by the player.
                <div class="image">
                    <center>
                        <img src="Files/Images/6.png" />
                        <br />
                        As LOD_0 is the original mesh, it is not possible to customize the minimum distance to see it.
                        The minimum distance to
                        view the LOD_0 is 0 units (Unity's unit of measurement, commonly associated with meters).Then
                        the minimum distance to see LOD_1 is 8 Units, the minimum distance to see LOD_2 is 20 Units and
                        the minimum
                        distance to see LOD_3 is 50 Units. As we leave the Culling option enabled, we can select the
                        minimum distance for culling to occur (we select 60 Units), if
                        the camera moves away from a distance greater than 60 Units, the meshes have been culled and
                        will no longer be visible
                        until the camera stay at a distance of less than 60 Units. If we choose to disable Culling, and
                        the camera moves away
                        from a distance greater than 50, the visible LOD will always be LOD_3, culling will
                        not occur because it is
                        disabled.
                    </center>
                </div>
                <b>Finally, generating the LODs</b> - Now, just click on the "Scan All Meshes And Generate LODs" button.
                After that, ULOD will scan all meshes it finds and
                create LOD levels for each one automatically, and after that your LODs will be ready! The ULOD component
                will
                automatically change LOD levels according to the current distance from the camera rendering the meshes.
                This camera is

                The process of undoing the creation of LODs is useful when you really just want to undo all the LODs
                created, or when
                you have updated things in the original meshes, and would like to bring all of that to the LOD levels

                button. After that, ULOD will erase all data collected
                from the original meshes and will delete all levels of created LODs (of course, keeping all of its
                original meshes
                intact) and will restore all original meshes back to Mesh Filters and Skinned Mesh Renderers. After
                undoing the creation of LODs, ULOD will also not perform any management or change of LOD meshes. You
                can do a new mesh scan and generate new LODs whenever you want.

                You can view information such as the name of the GameObject that contains the mesh, the name of the
                original mesh and
                format, and if you click on the "GameObject" button, ULOD will show you where that GameObject is.

                    Incredible Tips That Can Be Useful: Deactivating the LOD changes and displaying only original meshes
                    temporarily at runtime
                </div>
                In some situations, we need to disable LODs and display only the original quality meshes, no matter how
                far these meshes
                are from the camera. We have as an example, a shooting game, where there are weapons with a system of
                sight with zoom.
                <br>
                <br>
                Let's say the player picks up his weapon, looks at the horizon, switch to his aim and zoom out. We would
                not like to
                display a lot of low quality meshes (LOD_3) to the player, correct?
                <div class="image">

                        <img src="Files/Images/9.png" />
                        <br />
                        Player using sight and seeing distant models, however, in original quality
                    </center>
                </div>
                For this, ULOD has a special static C# API, with the function of disabling LOD management of all ULOD
                components in
                your scene. Thus, while the player is looking in the crosshairs, you can keep LOD management off, and
                when the player
                returns to normal view, you can activate LOD management again and all ULOD components will switch back
                to LOD meshes
                according to the distance from the current camera.

                </div>
                Sometimes, we have our own LOD meshes and we do not need ULOD to generate meshes automatically.
                Therefore, ULOD has a
                function that allows you to customize the meshes that will be displayed in each LOD of your meshes. In
                this topic, you can take a look at how to do this.
                <br>
                <br>
                Whenever ULOD does a scan, it adds a component called "Ultimate Level Of Detail Meshes" to all meshes
                scanned by it. In
                this component, you can view the LOD group, provide new meshes for each level in the LOD group and also
                do other useful
                things. This component also has a C# API so you can do these things at runtime too, if you prefer.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you delete the scan and LOD meshes generated by ULOD, these components will be
                removed
                automatically as well.

                    Incredible Tips That Can Be Useful: Optimization tips for using ULOD
                </div>
                ULOD has been tested and is a package focused on optimizing your project. ULOD has been tested with
                thousands of
                GameObjects in one scene, and has been able to transition LODs smoothly, without causing bottlenecks or
                performance
                drops, however, some practices must be taken into account to keep your game even more optimized and even
                more functional
                and intuitive to perform maintenance in the future. Some of them are...
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Avoid many unnecessary GameObjects</b> - A golden tip is, the less active GameObjects your scene has,
                the more optimized it will be. So, the tip here is, avoid
                your camera seeing MANY GameObjects on the screen, and whenever possible combine your meshes of your
                scene or characters
                in addition to reducing the count of GameObjects in the scene, also reducing the DrawCalls generated by
                each mesh in
                each GameObject different. You can use <b><a
                        href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/easy-mesh-combiner-mt-138805"
                        target="_blank">Easy Mesh Combiner MT</a></b> to combine
                the static meshes of your scene
                (Mesh Filters and Mesh Renderers) into just
                one mesh. And you can use the <b><a
                        href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/skinned-mesh-combiner-mt-135422"
                        target="_blank">Skinned Mesh Combiner MT</a></b> to combine all the
                meshes of your
                animated
                characters into one
                mesh. This can really bring huge performance gains, and after combining your meshes, you will only have
                1 mesh, so just
                use ULOD to create LODs from that mesh. You will experience an explosion of performance in your game
                after doing this!
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Avoid adding ULOD to each of your meshes</b> - As previously stated, ULOD was created with a focus on
                performance and is optimized for hundreds of GameObjects,
                however, as a complement to the previous topic, it is recommended that you avoid adding MANY ULOD
                components to your
                scene, more precisely, avoid placing a ULOD for each mesh in your scene. The most recommended is that
                you reduce the
                amount of GameObjects in your scene as much as possible, combine your meshes and add ULOD to a group of
                Meshes, so that
                a single ULOD component will manage the LODs of several meshes that are nearby and this will make things
                faster and
                allow you to invest in adding even more meshes to your scene. You can place as many ULODs as you want in
                your scene, but the tip here is, avoid placing unnecessary ULODs, so that you
                can add even more elements to your scene. For example, if you have a set of 10 trees that are close
                together, instead of
                adding a ULOD for each tree, group all these trees into a single GameObject (and if possible combine
                their meshes into
                just one) and place the ULOD in the GameObject parent of those meshes. So you will have a single ULOD
                managing the LOD
                of these 10 trees!

                    Incredible Tips That Can Be Useful: How to generate simplified versions of a mesh, without using the
                    "Ultimate Level Of Detail" component and save as file
                </div>
                Sometimes we just need to generate simplified versions (with less vertices) of a mesh, but we don't
                necessarily need an
                LOD controller for this. With this need in mind, the "Mesh Simplifier" window was created and introduced
                in the Ultimate
                LOD System. You can now generate simplified versions of a mesh and save it in the same directory to
                which the original
                mesh is located, automatically and in an organized manner.
                <div class="image">

                    </center>
                </div>
                First, you just need to open the simplification window. It can be opened by right clicking on a
                GameObject in your scene
                and then "Simplify Mesh", or by right clicking on a model file and then "Open With Mesh Simplifier" or
                simply go to
                "Tools > Ultimate LOD System > Mesh Simplifier Tool".
                <br>
                <br>
                To use, you simply need to provide a GameObject that contains a mesh, or a mesh directly, so choose the
                simplification
                parameters and click on "Generate Simplified Meshes". The simplified meshes will be saved in the same
                directory where
                the original mesh file is located.

                ULOD works well, however, like any tool it has its limitations. See below...
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Meshes with vertices occupied the same space</b> - Vertices that occupy the same space (or a position
                very very very close to another vertically atomically speaking) can
                be a problem for the internal mesh simplification algorithm. That said, meshes that have this
                characteristic can present
                hole problems in their LODs. ULOD will try its best to simplify these loops without any problems, but
                this is something
                that can happen.

                The Ultimate LOD System allows you to define a global distance multiplier (which automatically applies
                to all Ultimate
                LOD System components in all scenes). This multiplier affects the distances between the LODs of the ULOD
                components. The
                default value is "1.0", that is, if you have defined that the minimum distance to render LOD_1 is 20
                Units in a ULOD
                component, then that LOD_1 will only be rendered when the camera is 20 Units away from the ULOD
                component .
                <br>
                <br>
                If you change this multiplier to "2.0", then LOD_1 will be rendered with 10 Units, if you change to
                "0.0" then LODs will

                This can be relatively useful if you want to put a LOD quality setting in your game, where strong
                machines don't need
                the LOD system to work the same way as they do on a cell phone for example.

                The holes in the meshes may appear due to vertices that are occupying the same place as other vertices
                in your mesh, but
                if this does not happen to your mesh, try to activate the option "Prevent Artifacts Or Deform" before
                generating your
                LODs.

                If this happens, it may be due to some problem with the binding of your bones. This is usually fixed by
                enabling the
                "Skinned Anims Compat Mode" option.

                The most likely cause for this is that you have objects that are parents under bones that move with the
                animations.
                There is currently no way to deal with this limitation, and the best way to do this is to use lod groups
                nested with a
                ULOD component. Any object you know to be a parent under a bone must have its own LOD Group with a ULOD.

                </div>
                The Ultimate LOD System is fully compatible with Skinned meshes. ULOD will scan and change LODs of
                Skinned meshes
                without any problems, however, LOD changes simulation in the Unity Editor is disabled by default. This
                is because some
                versions of Unity have limitations that cause Editor to crash if skinned mesh LODs are changed.
                <br>
                <br>
                Even if the LOD changes simulation is disabled in the Editor, if you click on the ULOD component that
                manages the LODs
                of the Skinned Mesh Renderer meshes, you will see that it shows the LOD that is currently being
                rendered. So you have a sense of distance for each LOD.
                <br>
                <br>
                It is important to note that even if the LOD changes simulation is disabled by default in the Editor,
                if you compile
                and create your game (regardless of platform) the LOD changes will work without problems, and the
                meshes will be
                changed for LODs according to the distance from the camera. The non-functioning of the LOD changes
                simulation only
                applies to the Editor.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now that the important thing has been explained, it is also important to know, that there is an option
                to force the
                Ultimate LOD System to run the LOD changes simulation in the Editor. Just activate the "Editor Skinned
                LODs Change"
                option in the "Ultimate Level Of Detail" component and the Ultimate LOD System will do the LOD changes
                simulations in
                the Editor as well. But remember that this can make some versions of Unity crash.

                The Ultimate LOD System will always try to maintain the original
                shape of the meshes, be it a character, car, etc, but this can happen with thin walls (in walls or parts
                of
                houses that are
                composed of few vertices). The vertex reduction
                algorithm of the Ultimate LOD System will always try to render the vertices as much as possible, so when
                flat meshes
                that have few vertices pass through the algorithm, they have the vertices reduced from being square to
                being triangles
                for example, if a wall very thin composed of 4 vertices only, passes through the algorithm, the
                algorithm will leave the
                wall with 3 vertices, transforming it into a triangle and so on.

                        Representation. After configuring ULOD to ignore wall meshes, the problem will not occur again.
                        As the wall meshes have few vertices,
                        they will have a negligible impact on the game's performance, even if they do not have generated
                        LODs.

                </div>
                The best way to do this is to configure the "Ultimate Level Of Detail" component to ignore parts such as
                houses, or the
                walls of houses, to avoid deformations in these areas, so ULOD will generate LODs without deforming
                important parts of a
                construction.

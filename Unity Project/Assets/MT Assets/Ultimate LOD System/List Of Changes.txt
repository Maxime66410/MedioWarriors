	  CHANGELOG
/////////////////////

v2.2.1
	- Now the Ultimate LOD System has a new window so that you can generate simplified versions of a mesh, quickly and
	  easily, without having to go through the Ultimate Level Of Detail component. This can be very useful when you just
	  need to simplify a mesh, without needing LODs.
	- The distance detection and calculation algorithm was written to bring some stability improvements.
	- It is now possible for you to select the method that ULOD will use to detect the camera to calculate the distance
	  for simulating the LODs.
	- You can now define a custom camera for ULOD to calculate distances and perform LOD simulation.
	- Some optimizations and performance improvements were made in general.
	- Fixed a bug that caused LODs to not work correctly at runtime in URP and HDRP.
	- If you choose to detect the current camera that appears on the screen, the Ultimate LOD System will use its own
	  method to detect the camera that currently appears on the screen, ensuring greater compatibility and accuracy through
	  Unity versions and rendering pipelines.
	- The documentation has been updated to include updates.

v2.1.2
	- Some changes were made to the code. Aiming at some small improvements.
	- Some icons of the Ultimate LOD System have been redone for greater style.
	- The documentation has also undergone a slight reorganization of some topics.

v2.1.1
	- The Ultimate LOD System will now force the update to render the LODs automatically, if you provide a new mesh in
	  a "Ultimate Level Of Detail Meshes" component.
	- Some minor bugs have been fixed and some updates have been made.
	- The documentation has been updated to include new tips.

v2.0.1
	- Attention: In this update, several aspects, features and methods of the Ultimate LOD System have been updated
	  in order to improve the tool, so there is a small chance that you will have a problem with some existing scan
	  in your project. If so, just redo the scan on your "Ultimate Level Of Detail" components and everything will
	  be corrected and will work correctly. This is just a warning, in tests performed, this update did not show any
	  problems with older versions of Ultimate LOD System, however, I always recommend that you make a backup of your
	  project, before upgrading to this version.
	  **
	- The rendering method for the Ultimate LOD System has been updated.
	- The code has been updated to improve stability and organization.
	- Several small bugs have been fixed.
	- The documentation has been updated to reflect the new changes.
	- Now the Ultimate LOD System no longer needs to have a void "Mesh Renderer" component next to it.
	- A bug that caused mesh deformation and some error logs on the console during LOD changes, in some versions of
	  Unity, has been fixed. Please, if you still have any problems with error logs on the console, crashes or fast mesh
	  deformations during the LOD changes made by ULOD in Editor, after this update, please do not hesitate to contact
	  my e-mail address support "mtassets@windsoft.xyz". These problems did not occur during the game's runtime.
	- There have been some changes to the component UI to improve organization and functionality.
	- Now instead of clicking on the "View" button to view the distance of a LOD, you can click on one of the buttons
	  that appear ordered according to the amount of LODS you have chosen to create.
	- Now the Ultimate LOD System cull meshes far apart, after the last LOD level. You can choose how far the cullings
	  take place.
	- Ultimate LOD System now supports modularization of LODs. This means that now, you are no longer required to use
	  3 LOD levels every time. You can now choose from 1 LOD level, up to 8 LOD levels! There are LOD levels for all
	  needs and now you have more control!
	- Now, when modifying the viewing distance for each LOD, ULOD will automatically show you the distance on the scene
	  viewing camera. You also have buttons for quick access to view each LOD level.
	- Now the interface has become a little more intelligent, with some automatic parameter corrections.
	- You can now copy the distance parameters from the parent ULODs to the child ULODs.
	- Now the official version of the Ultimate LOD System, is 2019.3.x.
	- A bug that caused Unity to crash when changing the LODs of a Skinned Mesh Renderer, in version 2019.4.x has been fixed.
	- Now, the Ultimate LOD System will always give preference to the game camera, when simulating the LODs in the Editor.
	  If you are in game play mode, the camera that will be preferred will always be the game camera, instead of the scene
	  camera.
	- Now, the Ultimate LOD System, by default, will always leave the "Ultimate Level Of Detail Meshes" component on all
	  meshes scanned by it. Through this component, you can provide your own LOD meshes for each level, if you want, to
	  debug the meshes and do other types of actions. If you choose to undo the scan, these components will also be removed
	  automatically.
	- Fixed a bug that caused the Ultimate Level Of Detail Meshes not to work correctly for changing LOD meshes in some cases.
	- Some performance improvements have been made.
	- The "Ultimate Level of Detail Meshes" component, which is now automatically incorporated into all meshes scanned by the
	  Ultimate LOD System, now has a complete C# API, so you can change the LOD meshes that make up the LOD group of your mesh,
	  quickly, even at runtime.
	- A new global parameter has been added to ULOD. You can now define a global multiplier (which applies to all ULODs that are
	  components of all scenes). It is a LOD distance multiplier. As you increase or decrease this multiplier, greater distances
	  or shorter distances may be required, based on the distances you have configured in your ULOD components. The default value
	  for this multiplier is 1.0, which leaves all ULOD components working as expected and normal.
	- The C# API of the "Ultimate Level Of Detail" component has been improved with the addition of new methods.

v1.0.3
	- Fixed a bug that caused Unity to crash when ULOD changed the mesh of animated characters. This only happened
	  in the 2019.4.5 to 2019.4.9 versions.
	- The LOD change algorithm has been improved.
	- An issue that caused rapid deformation of the meshes during LOD exchanges has been fixed.
	- An issue that caused log errors to appear when building the game for Android or other platforms, has been fixed.

v1.0.2
	- Fixed a bug that caused Unity to crash when ULOD changed the mesh of animated characters. This only happened
	  in the 2019.4.5 to 2019.4.9 versions.

v1.0.1
	- The documentation is now stored inside a ZIP file to improve organization and facilitate opening in browsers.
	- The documentation has been updated with some minor changes.

v1.0.0
	- The Ultimate LOD System has just been released! I will always be working to support and add new features!
